# MRMCD'23 CTF

- no CTFTime entry

Small CTF on the MRMCD'23. We were kinda successful there. We solved almost all
challenges except four in the first few hours and then spend the next few days trying
to get these.

This repo contains two write-ups: for a crypto challenge and a DotNet exploitation
one.
